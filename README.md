## Etch-A-Sketch Project

### This project demonstrates DOM manipulation skills in what will be a simple browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch.

#### Assignment
1. Created a web page with a 16x16 grid of square divs.
2. Created divs using JavaScript.
3. Set up a hover effect so that when mouse passes over it, it leaves a pixelated trail through the grid.
4. Added buttons to the top of the screen which will clear the current grid and send the user a popup asking for how many squares per side to make the new grid. Once entered, the new grid should be generated in the same total space as before (e.g. 960px wide) and now youâ€™ve got a new sketch pad.
